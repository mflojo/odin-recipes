            <li>5 large garlic cloves, peeled and smashed</li>
            <li>1 tbsp kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/3 cup unsalted butter, cut into 8 pieces, plus more for serving</li>

            <li>Using a potato masher, mash in milk until smooth. Stir in 1 teaspoon salt and white pepper.</li>
            <li>Transfer potatoes to a serving bowl and top with more butter, if desired.</li>
