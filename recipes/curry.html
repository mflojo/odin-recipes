        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 3/4 pounds beef chuck, cut into 2 inch cubes</li>
            <li>3 onions, quartered</li>
            <li>1 tbsp ketchup</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp Worcetershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste (optional)</li>
            <li>water to cover</li>
            <li>4 carrots, cut into 3inch chunks</li>
            <li>1 cube chicken bouillon (optional)</li>
            <li>3 medium potatoes, cut into 3 inch chunks</li>
            <li>1 1/2 (3.5oz) containers Japanese curry roux, or more to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a 6-quart pot over medium-high heat. Add beef and saute until brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onions and cook until starting to soften, about 3 minutes. Add ketchup and Worcestershire sauce. Stir to coat. Add cayenne pepper. Pour in water to cover mixture by 1 or 2 inches. Add carrots and bouillon.</li>
            <li>Simmer, skimming fat off the surface of the broth as needed, for 30 minutes. Add potatoes. Stir in 1 package of curry roux and let dissolve; add remaining curry as needed to achieve desired thickness. Continue simmering until beef and vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes more.</li>
